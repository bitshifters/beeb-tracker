BeebTracker
~~~~~~~~~~~

Infrastructure
- Better build system
- Multiple source files (demo, player, exo) for library reuse

VGM Pre-process & Player
- Track length in metadata for tune progress (SM)
- Track speed in metadata for tracker update? (SM)
- Mapping from sound data to note notation for tracker (c#3f etc.) (SM)
- Ability to look ahead into sound data for upcoming tracker
- Song name & author metadata <- in VGM file or embedded in demo code? (SM)
- Support for looping tracks?
- Better extraction of frequency & beat data from tune for fx - GOOD ENOUGH! DONE

Scroll text FX
- Smaller font ~ 6x6 pixels per letter - DONE
- Store font as MODE 7 optimised data (2x3 pixels per byte) - DONE
- Rewrite for one pixel horizontal scrolling
- Ability to set scroll text message - DONE

VU FX
- Rewrite to only update changed teletexels not redraw entirely each frame - DONE
- Any changes to FX in general?
- Hook up to improved frequency & beat extraction

Tracker FX
- Write tracker display routine!
- Timer display routine (SM)

Loader FX
- Static MODE 7 screen at minimum
- Ideally animated - perhaps MODE 7 vector routines?
- Ability to drive animation on events whilst loading - DONE

Intro FX
- Static MODE 7 screen at minimum

Outro FX
- Static MODE 7 screen at minimum

Main Loop
- State machine for demo logic
	- Intro
	- Menu
	- Loading
	- Tracker
	- Outro
- (Would be nice if menu could overlay running tracker?)
- Cleanly kill & restart player - DONE
- Loader for VGM files - DONE
- Where is metadata for files etc. stored? - SM: Stuff into RAW file I think?
- (Compile time configuration from a file)
- Optimise draw routines for raster

Content
- Pick VGM music files for disk #1 (themed?)
- Assemble meta data
- Write scroll text for each file?
