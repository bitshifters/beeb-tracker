- Mapping from sound data to note notation for tracker (c#3f etc.) (SM) - DONE
- Ability to look ahead into sound data for upcoming tracker
- Song name & author metadata <- in VGM file or embedded in demo code? (SM)
- Support for looping tracks?
- Better extraction of frequency & beat data from tune for fx - GOOD ENOUGH! DONE

Scroll text FX
